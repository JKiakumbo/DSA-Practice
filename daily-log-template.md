#### **5. Blockers & Challenges**
*(What was difficult? What slowed you down?)*
*   `[Got stuck on an edge case for over 20 minutes because I didn't pseudocode first.]`
*   `[Had a hard time focusing after work. Tomorrow, try practicing in the morning.]`

---

#### **6. Wins & Achievements**
*(Celebrate your progress, no matter how small!)*
*   `[üéâ Solved the problem without looking at the solution first!]`
*   `[‚ö° Reduced the runtime of my solution from O(n^2) to O(n log n)]`
*   `[üí° Finally understood the "fast & slow" pointer pattern for cycle detection.]`

---

#### **7. Tomorrow's Preview**
*(What will you focus on tomorrow?)*

### **How to Use This Template Effectively:**

1.  **Be Consistent:** Fill it out at the end of every session. Consistency is more important than perfection.
2.  **Focus on Insights:** The "Key Insight" column is the most valuable. It forces you to articulate what you learned, solidifying the knowledge.
3.  **Track Time:** Be honest about your time. It helps you estimate problem difficulty and manage your schedule better.
4.  **Celebrate Wins:** The "Wins" section is crucial for motivation on difficult days.
5.  **Analyze Blockers:** Regularly review your "Blockers" to identify recurring issues (e.g., "always struggles with graph problems," "needs to work on recursion").
6.  **Integrate with Jira:** You can use this structure in a Jira ticket:
    *   **Summary:** `ICP Daily Log - [Date] - [Focus Pattern]`
    *   **Description:** Paste the entire template here.
    *   **Time Tracking:** Use Jira's built-in "Time Tracking" field for your `Total Focused Time`.
    *   **Labels:** Add labels like `daily-log`, `[pattern-name]`, `[difficulty]`.
    *   **Linked Issues:** Link the ticket to a parent epic like `ICP-5: Two Pointers Pattern`.
